Letʼs take a deeper look at the features of Notre Dame.<br>Notre Dame was constructed on the site of an early christian church, the Cathedral of<br>Saint-Étienne, in 1160, when the Bishop of Paris decided to build a larger, Gothic style<br>church.<br>Now, letʼs move on to the Physical Features of the cathedral.<br>Notre Dameʼs flying buttresses were built in 1200, to help support the roof and keep<br>the Cathedral structurally sound. Because of the immense weight of the roof, the walls<br>had to be thicker than a normal cathedral, and couldnʼt have large windows. Flying<br>buttresses remedied this by spreading the weight of the roof onto pillars outside the<br>main hall of the cathedral.<br>Notre Dameʼs gargoyles were built to ward off demons and evil spirits from<br>churchgoers, but also have an important role in draining water from the roof of the<br>cathedral. The traditional draining system of the time, with water running down the<br>walls of cathedral, would eventually erode the walls of the building and would not<br>withstand over time. Notre Dame uses a system where water is caught from the<br>gutters on the roof, and flows through the hollowed-out flying buttresses. At the end of<br>the flying buttresses, gargoyles are mounted, and are designed so the flowing water<br>appears to come out of the mouths of the creatures.<br>The three largest stained glass windows in Notre Dame, also known as the rose<br>windows, named after their petal shape, are one of the most well-known aspects of the<br>cathedral. The south window has 94 circles arranged in the shape of a flower, with<br>each depicting a scene from the bible, as well as variants saint and martyrs of France.<br>Notre Dameʼs Interior features a seating capacity of 9,000 people, with the standard<br>nave and apse of a church of that timeframe. The cathedral also housed 10 bells,<br>which throughout the middle ages have rung the time, call to prayer, as well as<br>significant events such as the crowning of a new king. A number of significant catholic<br>religious leaders have been laid to rest in the cathedral, including notable bishops and<br>archbishops of Paris.<br>The cathedral also featured numerous christian relics, including the Crown of Thorns,<br>which is what Jesus alledgedly wore on the cross, as well as a nail from the same<br>cross.<br>Notre Dame featured one of the largest organs of the age, built by Frédéric<br>Schambantz in 1403, which featured over 8,000 pipes.<br>Notre Dame was an icon of its time, and even after the devastating fire in 2019, will still<br>be an incredible example of art and engineering of the middle ages.</p>\n<p> </p>",
